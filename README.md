# PySword
PySword is a password manager application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to securely store and manage their passwords for various websites and services. The program uses a master password to encrypt and decrypt user passwords, which are stored in a local SQLite3 database.

The program has several key features:

Users can create a master password, which is used to encrypt and decrypt their passwords.\n
Users can add new accounts by providing the website, username and password, which are then encrypted and stored in the local database.
Users can view and manage their existing accounts by selecting them from a list of account names.
Users can generate random, secure passwords with the click of a button.
Users can edit or delete existing accounts and their details.
Users can search for a specific account by providing the account name and clicking the search button.
Users can also copy their password to clipboard.
The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with buttons for adding, editing, and deleting accounts, as well as a search function for finding specific accounts. Error messages appear in the active window, and users can copy their password to clipboard.

PySword aims to provide a simple, yet secure way for users to store and manage their passwords, making it easy to use while still providing the necessary security measures to protect their sensitive information.
